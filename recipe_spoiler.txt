Lodestaff Recipe (spoiler)


a) The basic lodestaff spawns an energy wisp to point your way back to its "home".
	Recipe:
	- 1x seeds from a vine fruit (Melon, Pumpkin, or Gourd seeds)
	- 1x seeds from a tree fruit (Apple, Orange, or Cherry seeds)
	- 1x any mushroom chunk
	- 1x grass clump (dig a grass-covered voxel)
	- 1x dirt, mud, clay, or sand clump (dig bare voxels, or below the surface)
	- 1x bamboo or wood shaft
	Drop everything on the ground and hit the 'G' key to start crafting. (No tool or workspace needed, at least for now.) 
	The lodestaff's "home" will be set to the spot where it appears. 


b) For a more powerful lodestaff, place the same items next to a natural crystal formation and hit the 'G' key. 	The energy released by the new lodestaff will follow you around instead of staying where it appears.


WARNING: these recipes use a great deal of your Seed's energy, so make sure you have food or a bed!
